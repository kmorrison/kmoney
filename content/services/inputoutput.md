Strings and more strings. We'll learn about every conceivable way to get data into and out of our programs, and how to use that data to make decisions and change the world.

# Input

How to get data from the people using our program, either via keyboard, files, filling out a form, or some other method. Modern programming is all about the transformation of data, and so we need to be a master of consuming that data wherever it is.

# Output

Now let's send that data back, either to the user, to a file, or to the network. We'll also talk about special types of outputs like databases and web-pages, though an in-depth discussion of those topics will be saved for a later module.
