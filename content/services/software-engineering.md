There is more to the modern software engineering job than just coding, and it's those extra skills that will make you stand out to future employers. In this module we'll learn the glue that holds the software industry together, and how to use it to make our lives easier.

# Collaboration

There's a saying that "software is written by people, for people". We need to learn how to write readable code, how to share it safely, how to show people our improvements, and how to prove to others than our code works and will _keep_ working. In the industry, `git` is the primary tool by which people track, share, and collaborate on code. We'll couple that with testing and continuous integration to make sure that our code is always working, and that we can always see when it stops working.

# Databases

Databases may seem scary, but we'll learn that our mental models of previous data structures can be applied to databases, and that they're just a different way of storing data. We'll learn how to use databases to store our data, and how to query them to get the data we need. We'll need to know the different kinds of databases, when to use each, and how a penny of forethought can save us dollars for time down the road.
