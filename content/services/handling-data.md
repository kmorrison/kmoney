Data is the blood of the software industry, the thing that makes it tick. In this module we'll learn about all the ways that we can manipulate, transform, and slice the data to gain insight and produce value.

# Common Algorithms

We'll learn the benefits, drawbacks, and applications of the most common algorithms used in industry, including sorting, filtering, and searching. We'll also learn a lot of the patterns that don't have a name, but are used all the time.

# Data Storage and Retrieval

Most data storage technology is built on the data structures and algorithms that we've already learned. We'll discover how to plan through our applications and choose the right data storage technology for the job.
