Programming, at its core, is making the computer do the work for us. In this module we'll learn the building blocks for those instructions, how to change and repeat ourselves, and how to organize our code into reusable chunks.

# Data Types

As we learn how to work with more and more data, deciding _how_ we're storing that data becomes increasingly important. We'll learn the most common data types, their advantages and disadvantages, and how to lean on them to solve problems for us. In other words, we'll learn how basically everything in programming is either strings, lists or dictionaries.

# Imports

As our programs get bigger, we'll want to reuse code we've already written. We'll learn how to import code from other files, and how to organize our code into modules that can be imported. Finally, we'll learn how to import code _other_ people have written, so that we don't have to solve the whole problem ourselves.
