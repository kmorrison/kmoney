Python is one of the most popular languages in the world, excelling at web development, data science, and general purpose programming, as well as being perfect for programming interviews. Its strength lies in combining a simple syntax with a powerful standard library, and a large community of developers. In this module, we'll learn what sets python apart, and how to use its unique toolset to solve problems that in other languages would take ten times as much code.

# Powerful Building Blocks

A key part of modern programming is being able to quickly and efficiently transform large amounts of data from one form to another, and python excels at this. We'll learn how to use the built-in python helpers to transform data in ways that would be impossible in other languages.

# Standard Library

Part of exploiting the unique power of python is standing on the shoulder of giants. We'll learn the most useful parts of the standard library, as well as how to explore its full extent to solve novel problems quickly and confidently.

# Python Shells

The final thing that sets python apart from most other popular languages is its interactive shell. We'll learn how to use the shell to quickly test ideas, and how to use the debugger to find bugs.
