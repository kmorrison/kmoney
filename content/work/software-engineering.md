Here we'll hone our craft and build the skills necessary for rock solid software. In other words, we'll transition from "New Grad" who knows how to code, to "Senior Engineer" who has the confidence to build complex systems.

This course builds on the [Programming]({{< ref "/work/programming" >}}), to which we'll add [Web Programming]({{< ref "/services/web-programming" >}}) and [Software Engineering]({{< ref "/services/software-engineering" >}}) concepts. Emphasis will be placed on collaboration, with special focus on code review cycles and testing. This may sound dry but these are the skills that separate new engineers from good engineers, and exactly what employers are looking for.
