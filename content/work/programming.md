Well on the road to mastery, in this course we'll be composing familiar and new concepts to create meaningful programs.

This course builds on the [Introductory Course]({{< ref "/work/introductory" >}}), to which we'll add [Data Handling]({{< ref "/services/handling-data" >}}) and [Advanced Python]({{< ref "/services/advanced-python" >}}) concepts. As with the introductory course, variation will be included to keep the material interesting and relevant.
