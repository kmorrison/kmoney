This program is dedicated to a unique yet important set of problems: programming interviews

This course builds on the [Programming]({{< ref "/work/programming" >}}), on top of which we'll add a special focus on time-saving python tricks, useful strategies and tactics for narrowing the scope of the problem, as well as periodic mock interviews to get used to the environment and track our progress.
