This program is dedicated to a unique yet important set of problems: programming interviews

This course builds on the [Programming]({{< ref "/work/programming" >}}), on top of which we'll add a special focus on time-saving python tricks, useful strategies and tactics for narrowing the scope of the problem, as well as periodic mock interviews to get used to the environment and track our progress.

Note: This module is also offered as a standalone course, aimed at preparing people who have upcoming interviews that they want to ace.

# Systems Design Interviews

In this subsection, we'll talk about what you can expect in a systems design interview, and how to prepare for it. We'll also go over some common interview questions, and identity resources that will allow us to go deeper into the topic.

# Coding-Focused Interviews

Here we'll discuss approaches for solving coding-focused interviews, in which we'll be presented with one or more iterative problems to solve. We should focus on ways to narrow the scope of the problem, and how to split up our time between requirements gathering, planning, coding, and testing.

# Mock Interviews

Mock interviews are a great way to get used to the interview environment, and to track our progress. We'll go over some common interview questions, and practice solving them in a mock interview setting.
