The goal of this program is to go from zero or cursory programming knowledge to a solid grasp of the fundamentals. 

Emphasis will be placed on working knowledge, building simple programs, and
establishing a good mental model from which we can build in the future. The
basis of this program will be [Basics]({{< ref "/services/basics" >}}) and
[Input/Output]({{< ref "/services/inputoutput" >}}), but we'll introduce some
variation depending on interest and goals.
